        <h1>About the Chef</h1>
        <p>This website contains some of my favorite recipes,
            and their respective grocery lists, in order to
            make your cooking adventures easy and enjoyable!</p>

            <h2>My Life</h2>
            <p>Here's a little bit about me!</p>

            <h3>Growing Up</h3>
            <p>Food was never a huge focus for me. I was lucky
                enough to have a mom who was kind enough to pack
                a lunch for me most days of the week.</p>

            <p>I would occasionally indulge in some pizza or tacos
                at the lunch line, but for the most part, my lunches
                were home-cooked.</p>

            <h3>Now</h3>
            <p>I'm not a very good cook, but I am capable of making
                a few staple recipes to keep myself alive and healthy.
                However, I do enjoy baking!
